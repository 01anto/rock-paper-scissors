  ## Mobile testing

   - The website was built from the start with mobile first design. It has been tested with
     chrome dev tools on smaller screens and it is responsive.
   - Once the website went live I accessed the website through various phones and ensured
     that it performed as expected.

  ## Desktop testing

 - Large Monitor and TV

   - The website has been tested with chrome dev tools for larger screens and it is
     responsive.
   - Once the website went live I accessed the website using a larger monitor and TV and
     ensured that it performed as expected. One issue occuring with the TV is highlighted below in unfixed bugs.

     as expected.

  ## Fixed Bugs

   - Upon running lighthouse it highlighted a contrast issue with my rules paragraph. The styling was adjusted and this increased my lighthouse score.
   - Upon running jshint it highlighted some missing semi-colons, unused variables left from testing and code layout issues. Once these were amended, i ran jshint again and no issues were detected.
  
  ## Unfixed Bugs

   - Some sound effects do not play on my lg TV. I tested for this on my laptop, desktop monitor and various phones which all played sound with no issues.
